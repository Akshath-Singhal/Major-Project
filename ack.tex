Setting an endeavor may not always be an easy task; obstacles are bound to
come in its way and when this happens, help is welcome and needless to say
without help of those people whom I am mentioning here, this endeavor
would not have been successful.

The satisfaction that accompanies the successful ongoing of this project would
be incomplete without the mention of the people who made it possible,
without whose guidance and encouragement would have made efforts go in
vain. I consider myself privileged to express gratitude and respect towards all
those who guided us.

I convey my sincere thanks to my project guide \textbf{Dr N S Raghava} (Professor,
 Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering) for providing
constant support, advice and suggestions which were of a great help. 

I am extremely happy to acknowledge and express my sincere gratitude to my parents for their constant suggestions and encouragement.
