The system developed during the project provides a low-cost testbed for aerial robotic swarms for testing of algorithms. The multi-rotors chosen provide a decent payload capacity for additional hardware like a lost cost camera or payload drop modules increasing the applications and usability of the said system.

The presence of a SITL Mavros swarm simulation environment provides a user-friendly rapid prototyping environment for researchers to ensure the reliability of the code before hardware testing. Also, the project helps to bridge the gap between user community and academic research by providing guidelines for easily reproducing the work for the community.
